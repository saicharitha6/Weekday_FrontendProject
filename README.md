# Candidate Application Platform

This task is to create a candidate application platform that allows users to view job listings, filter jobs based on various criteria, and implement infinite scroll for a seamless browsing experience. The platform should provide a user-friendly interface for viewing and applying to jobs.

I have created the simple UI for the below Requirements using react, redux, vanilla css. I also handle the null values. If some value is null it should not be seen in the UI of that job card. While filtering if you have applied a particular filter and the value corresponding to that filter is null in the jobDetails you need to filter that out.


Job Cards: Each job listing should be displayed as a card containing the following information:
Job title,
Company name, 
Location, 
Job description (limited to a certain number of characters with an option to expand),
Experience required,
Apply button,


Filters: Implement filters to allow users to refine the job listings based on:
Min experience,
Company name,
Location,
Remote/on-site,
Role,
Min base pay

Api Usage:
For the jobs data I have integrate the below api which takes limit and offset as request body parameter and returns the list of jobs and totalCount of jobs present.

# Getting Started with Create React App


# steps to run the project
First install npm after cloning project
## npm install

# How to Run the project
## npm start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
